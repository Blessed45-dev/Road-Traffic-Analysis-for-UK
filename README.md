# 🚦 UK Road Traffic Accident Analysis (2020)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road traffic accidents in the United Kingdom for the year 2020. It combines *machine learning, **association rule mining (Apriori), **clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN), and **outlier detection techniques* to draw insights and recommend safety interventions.

---

## 📊 Objectives
- Identify high-risk hours and days for various vehicle types.
- Analyze accident severity using classification models.
- Use Apriori algorithm to identify conditions linked to accident severity.
- Apply clustering and outlier detection to identify accident hotspots and anomalies.
- Provide practical policy recommendations based on findings.

## 🧠 Techniques & Models Used
- *Classification*: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naïve Bayes  
- *Clustering*: KMeans, DBSCAN  
- *Outlier Detection*: LOF (Local Outlier Factor), IQR  
- *Association Rules*: Apriori algorithm  
- *Evaluation Metrics*: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## 📈 Key Insights
- 🚗 *Peak accident hours*: 5 PM and 8 AM
- 🏍 *Fridays* had the highest accident rates for motorcycles (all engine sizes)
- 🚶‍♂ *Pedestrian accidents* peaked between 3–6 PM and on Fridays
- 📌 *Clusters revealed Kingston upon Hull as a hotspot* influenced by weather, speed limits, and lighting
- ⚠ *Outliers* identified accidents with *high casualties and few vehicles*, crucial for safety intervention modeling
